Competition Summary: [Photo](/docs/Descendere1022/rankings_2022.png) (The competition's website has been updated with current competition results.)

I'm responsible for program part of working with my colleagues on this project: [@OmsinKrissada](https://github.com/OmsinKrissada)

### **What is Descendere?**
  - [Descendere#1022](https://github.com/Bobeeeeeeee/DescendereSat) is team by [SPACE AC](https://github.com/SPACE-AC) that competing in the [Annual CanSat Competition 2022](https://www.cansatcompetition.com/) in [Blacksburg](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=Blacksburg), [Virginia](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=Virginia), [USA](https://www.google.com/search?q=USA). Organized by the [American Astronautical Society (AAS)](https://astronautical.org) 

### **What type of competition?**
  
  - This annual **competition international** is open to teams from universities and colleges. Teams must be able to design and build a space-type system, following the approved competition guide, and then compete against each at the end of two semesters to determine the winners. Rockets will be provided but teams are responsible for funding the construction of their CanSat and all travel/lodging expenses.

### **What is the mission? (Overview)**

  - [Competition Mission Guide 2022](/docs/Descendere1022/CanSat_Mission_Guide_2022.pdf)
  
  -  The mission is to simulate the landing sequence of a planetary probe.
  
  - Design a Cansat that shall consist of a container and a probe. The Cansat shall be launched to an altitude ranging from 670 meters to 725 meters above the launch site and deployed near apogee (peak altitude). Orientation of deployment is not controlled and is very violent with large shock forces. The Cansat must survive the forces incurred at launch and deployment.
  
  - Once the Cansat is deployed from the rocket, the Cansat shall descend using a parachute at a rate of 15 m/s. At 500 meters, the Cansat shall release a probe that shall open a heat shield that will also be used as an aerobraking device with a descent rate of 20 meters/second or less. A parachute, streamer, parafoil or similar device shall not be used with the heat shield. When the probe reaches 200 meters, the probe shall deploy a parachute and slow the descent rate to 5 meters/second. Once the probe has landed, it shall attempt to upright itself and raise a flag 500 mm above the probe. A video camera shall be included and point toward the ground during descent. 

### [**Preliminary Design Review (PDR)**](https://github.com/Bobeeeeeeee/DescendereSat/blob/main/Preliminary%20Design.pdf)

- A critical stage in the development of a CanSat project.

- The PDR serves as an important checkpoint to ensure that CanSat projects are heading in the right direction early in their development. It helps teams identify and address any fundamental design or feasibility issues before they invest significant time and resources into building and testing the CanSat.

- After successfully completing the PDR and receiving approval, teams can move on to the more detailed design work and preparations for the Critical Design Review (CDR) to further refine and finalize their CanSat design.

- Preliminary Design Review (PDR) entails

  - Initial Design Assessment
    - During the Preliminary Design Review, student teams present their initial design concepts for their CanSat project. This presentation includes an overview of the CanSat's proposed design, mission objectives, and key technical specifications.
  
  - Concept Validation
    - The purpose of the PDR is to validate the feasibility of the design concept. Judges or experts assess whether the proposed design and mission objectives are realistic and achievable within the competition's constraints.

  - Concept Refinement
    - Our teams may receive feedback from judges during the PDR. This feedback can help teams refine and improve their design before moving on to the more detailed Critical Design Review (CDR) stage.

  - Documentation
    - As part of the PDR process, teams often submit written documentation outlining their preliminary design, including block diagrams, rough sketches, and other relevant information.

  - Pass or Fail
    - The outcome of the PDR can vary. If the design concept is approved and deemed feasible, the team can proceed to the more detailed design and construction phase of the CanSat. If there are significant issues with the proposed design, the team may need to revise their concept and present it for another review.


### [**Critical Design Review (CDR)**](https://github.com/Bobeeeeeeee/DescendereSat/blob/main/Critical%20Design.pdf)

- A significant milestone in the development of a CanSat project, typically occurring before the actual construction and testing of the CanSat.

- The CDR process is crucial because it ensures that the CanSat project is well-planned, safe, and technically sound before the actual construction and launch. It helps identify potential issues early in the project, which can save time, resources, and improve the overall chances of success in the competition.

- Once the CDR is successfully completed, teams can move on to the fabrication and testing phase of their CanSat, working toward the goal of launching and completing the competition's mission objectives.

- Critical Design Review (CDR) entails
  
  - Design Evaluation
    - The CDR is a comprehensive evaluation of the CanSat's design. Our team present their detailed design plans and specifications, including the technical aspects of the CanSat, such as its structure, payload, sensors, communication systems, and any other critical components.

  - Review Process
    - The CDR is typically conducted as a formal presentation or review process in front of judges or experts in the field. These judges assess the design for its feasibility, functionality, safety, and compliance with competition rules.

  - Documentation
    - Teams are often required to submit written documentation that describes their CanSat's design in detail. This documentation should include schematics, technical drawings, and other relevant information.

  - Questions and Feedback
    - During the CDR presentation, teams may receive questions and feedback from the judges. This interaction allows teams to demonstrate their understanding of the project and make any necessary adjustments based on the feedback.

  - Pass or Fail
    - The outcome of the CDR can vary. If the design is approved and meets the competition requirements, the team can proceed with building and testing the CanSat. If the design is deemed inadequate or unsafe, the team may need to revise and resubmit their design for another review. 

### [**Post Flight Review (PFR)**](/docs/Descendere1022/Descendere_PFR_V2.pdf)

- An essential part of the CanSat project cycle and is conducted after the CanSat has been launched and retrieved.

- The Post-Flight Review is crucial for improving the design, performance, and reliability of CanSats in subsequent missions. It helps teams identify areas for improvement and refine their CanSat projects for future competitions or real-world applications.

- Post Flight Review (PFR) entails

  - Data Analysis
    - The data collected during the CanSat's flight is analyzed thoroughly. This includes any measurements, sensor readings, or other data that the CanSat collected during its flight.

  - Performance Evaluation
    - The performance of the CanSat is evaluated based on the mission objectives. This includes assessing whether the CanSat met its intended goals and objectives during the flight.
  
  - System Evaluation
    - The CanSat's systems and components are reviewed to determine if there were any issues or failures during the flight. This includes examining the functionality of the communication systems, sensors, and any other equipment on board.

  - Lessons Learned
    - The Post-Flight Review is an opportunity to reflect on what went well and what could be improved. It's a chance to identify lessons learned from the mission.

  - Reporting
    - The results of the Post-Flight Review are typically documented in a report. This report may include data analysis, findings, conclusions, and recommendations for future CanSat projects.
